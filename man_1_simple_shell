NAME
       hsh - A simple UNIX command interpreter (Shell)

SYNOPSIS
       ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh is a simple UNIX command interpreter (shell) that allows users to
       enter and execute basic commands. It provides a prompt, waits for user
       input, and executes the specified command.


INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       The shell supports the following interactive commands:

       exit
              Terminate the shell program.

       env
              Print the current environment variables.

COMMAND EXECUTION
       The shell processes user commands as follows:

       1. Display a prompt ($ ) and wait for user input.
       2. Read the user input and tokenize it into separate words.
       3. Trim leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
       4. If the input is "exit", terminate the shell.
       5. If the input is "env", print environment variables.
       6. Otherwise, attempt to locate and execute the specified command.

PATH RESOLUTION
       The shell locates executables using the PATH environment variable.
       If a command is not found in the current directory, the shell searches
       through directories listed in PATH to find the executable.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS
       The shell handles the following special characters:
       " ' ` \ * & #

EXIT STATUS
       The shell exits with status 0 upon successful execution of commands.
       If an error occurs during command execution, the exit status may vary.

EXAMPLES
       $ hsh
       $ $ ls
       file1 file2
       $ exit
